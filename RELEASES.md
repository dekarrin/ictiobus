v0.7.0 - April 20th, 2023
-------------------------
* Ictiobus is now self-hosted with a frontend for FISHI specs generated by
ictcc.

v0.6.1 - April 15th, 2023
-------------------------
* Diagnostics binary generation added. This binary contains a fully-functional
generated frontend and is capable of analyzing source written in the language
defined by the spec. Optionally, this binary can instead be instructed to
perform input simulation of the frontend instead of analyzing input files.
* All flags parsing now uses the spf13/pflag library for GNU-style options.
* added new flags to ictcc:
  * `-d`/`--diag` for generating a diagnostics binary for a language.
  * `-f`/`--diag-format-pkg` and `-c`/`--diag-format-call` for handling
  preprocessing of analyzed source in the diagnostics binary.
  * `-q`/`--quiet` to enable quiet mode to suppress progress output and other
  supplementary output.
  * `--preserve-bin-source` to keep source code output when it is generated as
  part of creating a binary.
  * `--prefix` to set a prefix for all generated source files. Combines well
  with `--preserve-bin-source` for debugging.
  * `--tmpl-main` to allow specification of the template used for the main.go
  file in generated binaries.
* Updated flags for ictcc:
  * added `-v` as shortcut for --lang-ver
  * changed `--val-sdts-off`, `--val-sdts-trees`, `--val-sdts-graphs`,
  `--val-sdts-first`, and `--val-sdts-skip` options to `--sim-off`,
  `--sim-trees`, `--sim-graphs`, `--sim-first-err`, and `--sim-skip-errs`
  respectively.
  * changed `--pre-format` to `--debug-templates` to betta demonstr8 its
  purpose.
* The current frontend for FISHI is now implicitly trusted as valid and will not
have input simulation run on it; `--sim-X` options now apply to the language
being analyzed.
* Fixed test of non-deterministic output of
`grammar.CreateFewestNonTermsAlternationsTable` by adding additional possible
success conditions for flaky cases.
* Added additional checks of SDTS sections of input specs during spec
interpretation (`%%actions` section):
  * Specs can no longer define new attributes starting with `$`.
  * Attribute refs must point to an existing symbol in their action's associated
  grammar rule.
  * Attribute refs to terminal symbols can only refer to the built-in attributes
  `$text` and `$ft`.
  * Attribute refs to non-terminal symbols cannot refer to `$text`.
* Improved error reporting during checks of SDTS sections of specs.
* Fixed boostrap lexer error where attribute refs to terminal symbols were lexed
as `TCTerminal` instead of `TCAttrRef`.


v0.6.0 - April 3rd, 2023
------------------------
* The ictcc binary can completely parse an entire FISHI spec and generate a
frontend. Yay! 38D
* Testing compiler for running SDTS now is put in `.sim` directory.
* Fixed several issues with fishi.md spec.

v0.5.3 - April 3rd, 2023
------------------------
* Re-release of v0.5.2 but with ictcc reporting the correct version.

v0.5.2 - April 3rd, 2023
------------------------
* Panics in SDTS hook functions are now caught and reported as errors.
* Code generation can now build all components of frontend.
* Added flags `-tmpl-*` for specifying tokens, lexer, parser, SDTS, and frontend
template files to use instead of the embedded default.
* Added flags `-slr`, `-ll`, `-clr`, and `-lalr` to select generation of that
type of parser as opposed to simply trying them until one is found that works.
* Added `-no-ambig` flag to disable the generation of LR parsers for languages
that have an ambiguous grammar.
* Added `-hooks`, `-hooks-table`, and `-ir` flags for specifying type
information and connecting external code to the generated frontend.

v0.5.1 - April 1st, 2023
------------------------
* Code generation started with templates for tokens, lexer, parser, SDTS, and
frontend.
* Add new flags for meta info during codegens, `-pkg`, `-dest`, `-l`/`-lang`,
and `-lang-ver`.
* New flag `-pre-format` added to output filled codegen template prior to
running gofmt on it.
* Renamed `translation` package to `trans` to keep it short.

v0.5.0 - March 30th, 2023
-------------------------
* The ictcc binary can now convert a FISHI AST into a language Spec. Use the
`-s/-spec` CLI option to enable outputting it.
* First token of a grammar construct is now available to SDTS as the `$ft`
("First Token") built-in attribute.
* Various fixes to fishi.md.

v0.4.1 - March 26th, 2023
-------------------------
* Renamed FISHI `%action` directive to `%set` so there is less ambiguity between
`%%actions` and `%action`.
* Added shorthand versions `->`, `(`, `:`, and `=` for `%prod`, `%with`, `%set`,
and `%hook` respectively to FISHI.
* Added ignored tokens `)`, `,`, and `()` in `%actions` of FISHI for parity with
`)`.
* Improved error reporting for SDTS validation errors.
* Split hooks into map of strings to hook function which is then passed to the
SDTS.
* Release candidate for complete fishi spec in fishi.md.

v0.4.0 - March 25th, 2023
-------------------------
* Added new flags to ictcc binary:
  * `-a`/`-ast` to print the AST it reads.
  * `-t`/`-tree` to print the parse tree it reads.
  * `-n`/`-no-gen` to disable generation of the frontend.
  * `-p`/`-parser` to specify the CFF parser to use.
  * `-no-cache` to disable loading the parser from a CFF file.
  * `-no-cache-out` to disable writing the parser to a CFF file.
  * `-version` to print the version number and exit.
  * `-val-sdts-off` to disable SDTS validation, `-val-sdts-trees` to show the
  parse trees that caused SDTS errors, `-val-sdts-graphs` to show full dep
  graphs when they are broken, and `-val-sdts-first` and `-val-sdts-skip` to
  control which SDTS validation errors are shown.
  * `-debug-lexer` and `-debug-parser` to show additional output from the parser
  and lexer while reading FISHI input.
* Fixed dozens of mistakes in bootstrap grammar to be able to parse an AST.

v0.3.0 - March 24th, 2023
-------------------------
* Created ictcc binary which can read FISHI-containing markdown files and output
the resulting AST.
* FISHI language and component changes:
  * Full `ictiobus.Frontend` creation for bootstrap frontend split into own
  file.
  * Added initial FISHI AST to use as IR.
  * Completed initial implementation of FISHI SDTS and hooks.
* SDTS functionality is now validated by automatic generation of valid blocks of
source text which are then fed to the SDTS.
* Updated terminology referring to "SDD" to correctly refer to SDTS.
* `ictiobus.Frontend` now holds language metadata and debug options.
* Fixed unit tests and commented out harder ones to be fixed later.
* Frontend components can now be encoded to disk as bytes in "Compiled FISHI
Format" (CFF). Used for the parser to increase testing speed.
* Added CI validation of gofmt and test execution.

v0.2.0 - March 4th, 2023
------------------------
* Moved `fishi.go` into own sub-package, `ictiobus/fishi`.
* Split the bootstrap lexer, parser, and tokens from `fishi.go` into their own
respective files in `ictiobus/fishi`.
* Created stubbed bootstrap SDTS in own file in `ictiobus/fishi`.
* Added ability to 'prioritize' which token is lexed first.
* Rough fixes to how syntax errors display the source line they were found on.

v0.1.0 - March 4th, 2023
------------------------
* Moved entire in-progress codebase over from its origin as a sub-project of
